ISOMAP and PCA Techniques

### Order of Faces using ISOMAP
This question aims to reproduce the ISOMAP algorithm results in the original paper for ISOMAP, J.B. Tenenbaum, V. de Silva, and J.C. Langford, Science 290 (2000) 2319-2323.
The file contains 698 images, corresponding to different poses of the same face. Each image is given as a 64x64 luminosity map. This vector is stored as a row in the file.

### Eigenfaces and simple face recognition.
This question is a simplified illustration of using PCA for face recognition. We will use a subset of data from the famous Yale Face dataset.
